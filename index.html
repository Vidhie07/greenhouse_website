Tackling the climate crisis is the most pressing challenge of our time, and our handling of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO₂) plays a key role in this. Simply, the more of it is in our atmosphere, the warmer it gets on our planet. Since the industrial revolution, the concentration of atmospheric CO₂ has been steadily rising faster. We are clearly witnessing the consequences; today, the Earth is about one degree (Celsius) warmer than it was at the end of the 19th century, causing a rise in sea levels, a greater frequency of extreme weather conditions, destruction of habitats, and a growing scarcity of food.

Scientists expect this trend to continue. Nevertheless, we are not powerless in the face of these developments. But we must act urgently now:

                   <p> Earth’s various ecosystems offer us a variety of so-called nature-based solutions. These ecosystems draw CO₂ from the atmosphere and, thus, support us in mitigating climate change. These include marshes, oceans – and forests!

                    <br>

A study by ETH-Zurich has shown that 900,000,000 hectares of land are available for reforestation worldwide – without restricting our existing infrastructure or agriculture. This is roughly 25 times the area of Germany. Trees have numerous other benefits besides the positive effect on our climate:</p>
