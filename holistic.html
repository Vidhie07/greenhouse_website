        <div class="first-approach">
            <div class="lefttext">1. Build Relationships
              Smallholder farmers in the tropics are at the center of our work. They are indispensable for sustainable rainforest conservation. We build long-term relationships with the local communities and identify the individual needs of the people in order to help them in the best possible way through our joint activities. </div>

          <div class="lefttext">2. Empower Farmers
            In so-called Farmer Field Schools, the experiences and knowledge of smallholder farmers are supplemented with knowledge from expert foresters. In the courses, participants learn basic concepts and techniques of agroforestry and apply them in workshops in the field. </div>
          
      </div>
      
        <div class="first-approach">
            <div class="lefttext">3. Distribute Seedlings
              Every year, our nurseries and those of our partners’ raise hundreds of thousands of seedlings that are distributed to smallholder farmers free of charge for the planting season. In order to provide the participants of the programs with the appropriate seedlings for the conditions in their fields, we establish our own test fields to expand our knowledge year after year.</div>

          <div class="right-images"><img src="images/Timber-Innovation-Center.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="lefttext">4. Establish Responsible Value Chains
              An important part of our holistic approach is the development of sustainable value chains. We link smallholder farmers with the wood processing industry to provide a sustainable source of income to them. We also explore new uses for the planted lightwoods. For instance, we aim to introduce them in the construction sector, where they can replace emission-intensive materials such as concrete.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="first-approach">
        
            <div class="lefttext">5. Monitor Impact
              Transparent and responsible action is one of the guiding principles of our work. That’s why we developed TREEO – an app that makes it easy for smallholder farmers to independently collect data from their fields. TREEO allows us to track the growth of trees and record the CO2 stored as biomass. With the help of the data, we can continuously optimize our activities and provide advice and support that is tailored to smallholders.</div>

At Fairventures, we champion locally grown timber for construction, as the production of materials such as concrete and plastic emit large amounts of CO2. As a means of forestry protection, CO2 compensation, as well as sustainable production and construction, we study and promote local woods in Uganda and Indonesia that can be quickly grown by local farmers and used in eco-friendly construction.

              <div class="text">"One of the fastest ways to stop rising global temperatures is carbon sequestration. Fairventures promotes fast-growing lightwood timber species and mass timber construction of buildings with a triple benefit for carbon sequestration: absorption of CO2 in the growing trees, long-term storage in lasting timber products and buildings, and substitution of emission-intensive materials like steel and concrete by timber products. In turn, such projects connect companies, governments, and private persons."</div>

Biodiversity is the basis for life and therefore, unsustainable land-use systems such as monocultures must be avoided. This can only be accomplished with an economically viable alternative for the local communities. Fairventures works together with farmers to reforest degraded land and increase biodiversity. The farmers use fast-growing timber species like Sengon to restore soils and site productivity."</div>
